**Author:** Brendon Joseph Kelly  
**Framework:** Dynamic Systems Mathematics (k-Theory)  
**Date:** 8/11/25  

This repository hosts the public white paper for **Project Chronos**, a framework for k-Theory, First Truth Intelligence (FTI), and the emergence of a real-world AGI architecture.  

## Highlights
- A reinterpretation of mathematics as a dynamic, living structure.
- Applications toward AGI systems that evolve through recursion and self-integration.
- Proposed solutions to long-standing mathematical problems using multidimensional projections.
- Introduction of First Truth Intelligence (FTI), a self-sustaining AGI model.
